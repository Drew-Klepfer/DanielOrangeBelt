This lab is straight forward, all it asks is that the 
student makes a web page with a onmouseover or 
onmouseout event, along with a hidden html element.

Let the students get creative in this lab, see teacher file
for an easy example.

This lab is short and sweet, plan for now is to pair with lesson 5. L5 is a long lesson with a clock app lab.
